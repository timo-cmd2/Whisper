# Whisper
An elegant, privacy-focused and secure messenger app for iOS. `wip`

This implementation features:

- support on Apple devices
- elegant and simple UI
- powerful encryption (end-to-end)
- no third-party access to data
- full transparency
- able to send messages (image, text, emoji)
- homemade and hand-crafted by love

> Note: This branch is still under heavy construction and not yet finished. I suggest not to use Whisper yet in production.
